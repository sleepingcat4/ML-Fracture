They are:\n\nCT scan. CT scans can uncover wrist fractures that X-rays miss. Injuries to soft tissues and blood vessels can be seen on CT scans. This technology takes X-rays from a variety of angles and combines them to depict cross-sectional slices of your body's internal structures.\nMRI. Using radio waves and a powerful magnet to produce detailed images of bone and soft tissues, MRIs are much more sensitive than X-rays and can identify very small fractures and ligament injuries.\nMore InformationBone scanCT scanMRIX-rayShow more related information\n\nTreatmentIf the broken ends of the bone aren't aligned properly, there can be gaps between the pieces of bone or fragments might overlap. Your doctor will need to manipulate the pieces back into position, a procedure known as a reduction. Depending on the amount of pain and swelling you have, you might need a local or general anesthetic before this procedure.\nWhatever your treatment, it's important to move your fingers regularly while the fracture is healing to keep them from stiffening. Ask your doctor about the best ways to move them. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can delay or prevent bone healing.\nImmobilizationRestricting the movement of a broken bone in your wrist is critical to proper healing. To do this, you'll likely need a splint or a cast. You'll be advised to keep your hand above heart level as much as possible to reduce swelling and pain.\nMedicationsTo reduce pain, your doctor might recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever. If your pain is severe, you might need an opioid medication, such as codeine.\nNSAIDs can help with pain but might also hamper bone healing, especially if used long-term. Ask your doctor if you can take them for pain relief.\nIf you have an open fracture, in which you have a wound or break in the skin near the wound site, you'll likely be given an antibiotic to prevent infection that could reach the bone.\nTherapyAfter your cast or splint is removed, you'll likely need rehabilitation exercises or physical therapy to reduce stiffness and restore movement in your wrist. Rehabilitation can help, but it can take several months or longer for complete healing.\nSurgical and other procedures\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    External fixation of the wrist\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nExternal fixation of the wrist\n\n\nExternal fixation of the wrist\nWith external fixation, a metal frame outside your body immobilizes the fracture with two or more pins that pass through your skin and into the bone on either side of the fracture.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might need surgery to implant pins, plates, rods or screws to hold your bones in place while they heal. A bone graft might be used to help healing. These options might be necessary if you have:\n\nAn open fracture\nA fracture in which the bone pieces move before they heal\nLoose bone fragments that could enter a joint\nDamage to the surrounding ligaments, nerves or blood vessels\nFractures that extend into a joint\n\nEven after reduction and immobilization with a cast or splint, your bones can shift. So your doctor likely will monitor your progress with X-rays. If your bones move, you might then need surgery.\nIn some cases, the surgeon will immobilize your fracture by using an external fixation device. This consists of a metal frame with two or more pins that go through your skin and into the bone on both sides of the fracture.\nRequest an appointment\n\nClinical trials\n\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\r\n    \nPreparing for your appointmentYou might first seek treatment for a broken wrist in an emergency room or urgent care clinic. If the pieces of broken bone aren't lined up properly to allow healing with immobilization, you might be referred to a doctor specializing in orthopedic surgery.\nWhat you can doYou may want to write a list that includes:\n\nA description of your symptoms and how, where and when the injury occurred\nInformation about your and your family's medical histories\nAll the medications and dietary supplements you take, including doses\nQuestions you want to ask the doctor\n\nFor a broken wrist, questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat tests do I need?\nWhat's the best course of action?\nWill I need surgery?\nWill I need to wear a cast? If so, for how long?\nWill I need physical therapy when the cast comes off?\nAre there restrictions that I need to follow?\nShould I see a specialist?\n\n What to expect from your doctorYour doctor might ask:\n\nWhat is your occupation?\nWas your wrist bent backward or forward when the impact occurred?\nAre you right-handed or left-handed?\nWhere does it hurt, and do certain movements make it hurt more or less?\nHave you had previous wrist injuries or surgery?\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\nRequest an appointment\n\nSymptoms & causesDoctors & departments\n\r\n    June 29, 2022\r\n\nPrint\n\nShow references\nWrist fractures.
