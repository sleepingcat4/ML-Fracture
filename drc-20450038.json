The precise location of your pain can help determine its cause.Your doctor may move your foot into different positions to check your range of motion. You may be asked to walk for a short distance so that your doctor can examine your gait.TestsIf your signs and symptoms suggest a break or fracture, your doctor may suggest one or more of the following imaging tests.\nX-rays. Most ankle fractures can be visualized on X-rays. The technician may need to take X-rays from several different angles so that the bone images won't overlap too much. Stress fractures often don't show up on X-rays until the break actually starts healing.\nBone scan. A bone scan can help your doctor diagnose fractures that don't show up on X-rays. A technician will inject a small amount of radioactive material into a vein. The radioactive material is attracted to your bones, especially the parts of your bones that have been damaged. Damaged areas, including stress fractures, show up as bright spots on the resulting image.\nComputerized tomography (CT). computed tomography (CT) takes X-rays from many different angles and combines them to make cross-sectional images of internal structures of your body. CT scans can reveal more detail about the injured bone and the soft tissues that surround it. A CT scan may help your doctor determine the best treatment for your broken ankle.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create very detailed images of the ligaments that help hold your ankle together. This imaging helps to show ligaments and bones and can identify fractures not seen on X-rays.\nMore Information Bone scan CT scan MRI X-rayTreatmentTreatments for a broken ankle will vary, depending on which bone has been broken and the severity of the injury.MedicationsYour doctor may recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).TherapyAfter your bone has healed, you'll probably need to loosen up stiff muscles and ligaments in your ankles and feet. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to improve your flexibility, balance and strength.Surgical or other procedures\nReduction. If you have a displaced fracture, meaning the two ends of the fracture are not aligned well, your doctor may need to manipulate the pieces back into their proper positions. This process is called reduction. Depending on the amount of pain and swelling you have, you may need a muscle relaxant, a sedative or a local anesthetic to numb the area before this procedure.\nImmobilization. A broken bone must be immobilized so that it can heal. In most cases, this requires a special boot or a cast.\nSurgery. In some cases, an orthopedic surgeon may need to use pins, plates or screws to maintain proper position of your bones during healing. These materials may be removed after the fracture has healed if they are prominent or painful.\n Request an appointmentClinical trialsExplore Mayo Clinic studies\u00a0testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\nPreparing for your appointmentYou will likely initially seek treatment for a broken ankle in an emergency room or urgent care clinic. If the pieces of broken bone aren't lined up properly for healing, you may be referred to a doctor specializing in orthopedic surgery.What you can doYou may want to write a list that includes:\nDetailed descriptions of your symptoms\nInformation about medical problems you've had\nInformation about the medical problems of your parents or siblings\nAll the medications and dietary supplements you take\nQuestions you want to ask the doctor\nFor a broken ankle, basic questions to ask your doctor include:\nWhat tests will I need?\nWhat treatments are available, and which do you recommend?\nIf I need a cast, how long will I need to wear it?\nWill I need surgery?\nWhat activity restrictions will I need to be follow?\nShould I see a specialist?\nWhat pain medications do you recommend?\nDon't hesitate to ask any other questions you have.What to expect from your doctorYour doctor may ask some of the following questions:\nWas there a specific injury that triggered your symptoms?\nDid your symptoms come on suddenly?\nHave you injured your ankles in the past?\nHave you recently begun or intensified an exercise program?\nWhat to do in the meantimeIf your injury isn't severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room, here are some things you can do at home to care for your injury until you can see your doctor:\nApply ice for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, every three to four hours to bring down the swelling.\nKeep your ankle elevated.\nDon't put any weight on your injured ankle.\nLightly wrap the injury in a soft bandage that provides slight compression.\n Request an appointment By Mayo Clinic StaffMar 26, 2022 PrintShow ReferencesBrunicardi FC, et al., eds.
