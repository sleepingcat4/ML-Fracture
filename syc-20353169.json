It usually occurs when people fall on an outstretched hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nA broken wrist is a break or crack in one or more of the bones of your wrist. The most common of these injuries occurs in the wrist when people try to catch themselves during a fall and land hard on an outstretched hand.\nYou may be at higher risk of a broken wrist if you participate in sports like in-line skating or snowboarding, or if you have a condition in which bones become thinner and more fragile (osteoporosis).\nIt's important to treat a broken wrist as soon as possible. Otherwise, the bones might not heal in proper alignment, which might affect your ability to do everyday activities, such as writing or buttoning a shirt. Early treatment will also help minimize pain and stiffness.Products & ServicesA Book: Mayo Clinic on OsteoporosisMayo Clinic Sports MedicineShow more products from Mayo Clinic\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptomsA broken wrist might cause these signs and symptoms:\n\nSevere pain that might worsen when gripping or squeezing or moving your hand or wrist\nSwelling\nTenderness\nBruising\nObvious deformity, such as a bent wrist\n\nWhen to call a doctorIf you think you might have a broken wrist, see a doctor immediately, especially if you have numbness, swelling or trouble moving your fingers. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to poor healing, decreased range of motion and decreased grip strength.\nRequest an appointment\n\nCausesA broken wrist can be caused by:\n\nFalls. Falling onto an outstretched hand is one of the most common causes of a broken wrist.\nSports injuries. Many wrist fractures occur during contact sports or sports in which you might fall onto an outstretched hand \u2014 such as in-line skating or snowboarding.\nMotor vehicle crashes. Motor vehicle crashes can cause wrist bones to break, sometimes into many pieces, and often require surgical repair.\n\nRisk factorsParticipating in certain sports activities and having the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis can increase your chances of breaking a wrist.\nSports activitiesContact sports and activities that increase your risk of falling can increase your risk of breaking bones in your wrist. Examples include:\n\nFootball or soccer, especially on artificial turf\nRugby\nHorseback riding\nHockey\nSkiing\nSnowboarding\nIn-line skating\nJumping on a trampoline\n\nComplicationsComplications of a broken wrist are rare, but they might include:\n\nOngoing stiffness, aching or disability. Stiffness, pain or aching in the affected area generally goes away eventually after your cast is removed or after surgery. However, some people have permanent stiffness or pain. Be patient with your recovery, and talk to your doctor about exercises that might help or for a referral to physical or occupational therapy.\nOsteoarthritis. Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later. If your wrist starts to hurt or swell long after a break, see your doctor for an evaluation.\nNerve or blood vessel damage. Trauma to the wrist can injure adjacent nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate attention if you have numbness or circulation problems.\n\nPreventionIt's impossible to prevent the unforeseen events that often cause a broken wrist. But these tips might offer some protection.\nBuild bone strengthTo build strong bones:\n\nEat a nutritious diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D\nGet plenty of weight-bearing exercise, such as brisk walking\nQuit smoking if you're a smoker\n\nPrevent fallsMost broken wrists occur when people fall forward onto an outstretched hand. To prevent this common injury:\n\nWear sensible shoes\nRemove things you can trip over in your home, such as throw rugs\nLight up your living space\nHave your vision checked and, if needed, corrected\nInstall grab bars in your bathroom\nInstall handrails on your stairways\nAvoid slippery surfaces, if possible, such as snow- or ice-covered walkways\n\nUse protective gear for athletic activities\nWear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as:\n\nIn-line skating\nSnowboarding\nRugby\nFootball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\nRequest an appointment\n\nDiagnosis & treatment\n\r\n    June 29, 2022\r\n\nPrint\n\nShow references\nWrist fractures.
