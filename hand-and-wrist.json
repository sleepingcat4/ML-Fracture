Check with your preferred location in advance.\n\n \n\n\n\nArthritis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have swelling, pain and reduced motion in your hands and wrists? If you answer yes to this question, you may be suffering from\u00a0arthritis. Our trained staff can help effectively manage your arthritis symptoms with medical and surgical therapies.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Using your hands and fingers is something you likely do without thinking, until numbness and tingling occur, which can prevent you from performing daily tasks.\u00a0Carpal tunnel syndrome\u00a0occurs when you have a pinched nerve in your wrist. If splinting and rest haven't helped, our experts will recommend surgery options to restore function in your hands and fingers.\n\n\nCarpal tunnel anatomy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0A passageway from the wrist to the hand, the carpal tunnel is made of tendons, ligaments and bones. The median nerve passes through the tunnel and provides sensation to your thumb, index finger, middle finger and the thumb-side of the ring finger.\n    \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCarpal tunnel release\u00a0\u2013\u00a0During carpal tunnel release, a surgeon makes an incision in the palm of your hand over the carpal tunnel ligament and cuts through the ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve. The surgery may be done by making one incision on the palm side of the wrist, or by making several small incisions.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDupuytren's Contracture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDupuytren's contracture\u00a0is a slow-forming hand deformity that affects a layer of tissue that lies under the skin of your palm. Knots of tissue form under the skin, eventually creating a thick cord that can pull one or more fingers into a bent position. This condition mainly affects your ring finger and pinky. Treatment options include injection or surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFractures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking your hand or wrist can happen easily during a fall, especially if your bones are thin and fragile from\u00a0osteoporosis. It\u2019s important to come see us right away if you have a fracture so that we can minimize your pain and get you back to normal function as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nNerve lacerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour\u00a0peripheral nerves\u00a0are fragile and easily injured during trauma. If you had an injury that caused a laceration, you will feel numbness, weakness or tingling. If your nerve is lacerated or divided in two, our expert surgeons will reconnect the nerve ends.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTendinopathies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflammation of a tendon can occur in any part of your body, which causes tenderness and pain with any movement you make in that area. If you've tried rest, ice and over-the-counter pain relievers and are still experiencing pain, we can help.\u00a0Our skilled providers\u00a0will talk with you to decide if a steroid injection or surgery is best to relieve your pain and prevent further injury. Conditions that can result from tendonitis include\u00a0trigger finger\u00a0and\u00a0De Quervain's tenosynovitis.\n\n\nTrigger finger\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Trigger finger generally results from inflammation within a tendon sheath, restricting tendon motion. A bump (nodule) also may form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Quervain's tenosynovitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0A test called the Finkelstein test can help your doctor confirm de Quervain's tenosynovitis. To do this test, first bend your thumb down across the palm of your hand, covering your thumb with your fingers. Next, bend your wrist toward your little finger. If this causes pain, there is a chance you may have de Quervain's tenosynovitis.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                    Stay Connected\r\n                \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Contact Us\n \n\n Notice of Nondiscrimination\n \n\n Notice of Privacy Practices\n \n\n Terms of Use\n \n\n Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n About Us\n \n\n Careers\n \n\n Volunteer\n \n\n Donate\n \n\n\n\n\n\n For Patients & Visitors\n \n\n Financial Assistance\n \n\n Price Transparency\n \n\n Community Resources\n \n\n Mayo Clinic Connect\n \n\n\n\n\n\n For Medical Professionals\n \n\n Press Room\n \n\n Mayo Clinic\n \n\n Home\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            \u00a9 2018 - 2024 Mayo Clinic Health System\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n"
